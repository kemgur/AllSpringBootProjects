1)How to create Form-Based Authentication
Answer: Add following dependency into pom.xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.springframework.boot</groupId>
    <artifactId>spring-boot-starter-security</artifactId>
</dependency>
Note: When you add dependecy and run the application, SpringBoot will generate a password for you and username will "user" everytime. By using generated password and "user" as username you can access to database.
2)What are the cons of Form-Based Authentication?
a)When user uses username and password once, user will be able to use all request methods, this is not good.
b)Without logging out, the application might be logged in constantly
c)User should enter username and password manually.

Go to application.properties file an add the followings
spring.security.user.name=techproed
spring.security.user.password=123456789
4)Get Request method has less security than the others in SpringBoot
